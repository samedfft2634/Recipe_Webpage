# Recipe_Webpage
I watched and made this page with John Smilga's narration and it was very instructive. I have learned too many structures about webpages. For example, grid layout, css variables, flexboxes and finally working with few html pages. <br> <br>
Thank you John: 🙏 <br> https://johnsmilga.com/ <br><br>
